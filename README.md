# handwritten-digit-recogntion
Personal portfolio python project that will be implementing a machine learning model to predict the value of a handwritten digit through supervised learning. The algorithm itself will be given a large dataset from *sci-kit learn*.

## About
Reading letters & numbers off of a sheet of paper is profoundly intuitive for us humans, as our visual cortex has developed and evolved for thousands of years. For computers, on the other hand, interpreting strokes from a sheet of paper algorithmically is incredibly difficult. However, due to their immense processing speed, computers can take in massive amounts of data to therefore effectively *learn* and *predict* what a particular digit means. 

The Regression Model that I've opted for this particular project is the SVM model, or *linear Support Vector classification*. Although there are different approaches it is difficult to appoint a specific regression model as superior, as it depends on the criteria or project scope. However, SVM is the preferred method as it allows for the fine-tuning of parameters to achieve better accuracy.

## Dependencies
* Python
* Sklearn
* matplotlib

## Versions
**Low-Level**
In the lower-level approach, you will see how a computer can read a large data set and output the users chosen element from the data structure.

**High-Level**
In the latter, higher-level, the user will be able to simply write a digit, through an input dialog, for the computer to interpret.
